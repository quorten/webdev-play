Web Dev Play
============

This is the "playground" where I stage all my useful web development
code.  Currently, there are a few main projects emerging:

* `dumb_cgipm`: A C library equivalent of the Perl CGI.pm library.

* `dmy_house_logs`: House logs for dummies, a primitive electronic
  logging systems for home operations and house maintenance
  activities.

* `citi`: A primitive but web-enabled toy government citizens records
  keeping system.

* `dumbank`: A primitive web-based toy electronic banking system.
