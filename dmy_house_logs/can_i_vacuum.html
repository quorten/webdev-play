<h1>Can I vacuum now?</h1>

<p>This is your scheduling tool to assist you in vacuuming outside of
working hours and sleeping hours.  Right now is just some rules of
thumb for scheduling, but in the future, this will pull in work
calendar data, allow you to look into the future, and allow you to
schedule planned vacuuming in the future.</p>

<p>Current time: TODO SCRIPT THIS</p>

<p><strong>Can I vacuum now?  TODO SCRIPT THIS</strong></p>

<p>Reason: TODO SCRIPT THIS, list who is working/sleeping in the time
frame</p>

<p>Remember, to protect your back, always log your start and finish
times for vacuuming when you actually do it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rule of thumb clear to go hours: Any day from 7 AM to 8 AM, 6 PM
  to 9 PM, Thursday and Sunday especially "safe."  Away from the
  upstairs bedrooms is generally less restricted in vacuuming.</li>
  <li>Keep clear of sleeping hours, 9 PM to 7 AM</li>
  <li>Keep clear of general working hours, Monday through Friday, 8 AM
  to 6 PM</li>
  <li>Keep clear of Nadia's working hours, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
  Friday, Saturday, 9 AM to 6 PM.  Could Nadia work overtime?</li>
  <li>Sunday afternoon, but typically before 6 PM, is one of the
  favorable times for naps for Dad, Nadia, and sometimes Anna.</li>
